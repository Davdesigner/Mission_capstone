# 🌾 AminoRice – AI-Based Rice Quality Assessment System
##📌 Description

RiceVision is an AI-powered computer vision system designed to automatically assess rice quality indicators from grain images. The system uses deep learning techniques to predict key quality metrics such as grain count, broken grains, chalky grains, and dimensional characteristics.

This project was developed as part of a Mission Capstone focused on leveraging Artificial Intelligence to enhance agro-industrial value chains, particularly within African rice markets.

## The solution combines:

Image preprocessing and augmentation

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) modeling

Multi-output regression for rice quality metrics

API-ready deployment structure

Mobile application interface mockup

The objective is to provide a scalable, field-ready digital solution for farmers, processors, and quality inspectors.
